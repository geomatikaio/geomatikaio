### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a founding partner of _Landmap Mapeamento e GeosoluÃ§Ãµes_, a company that uses geotechnology tools to provide answers to several problems in the industry. I am interested in remote sensing, geographic information systems and putting it all together in free software, using programming in Python and R. I am a Linux enthusiast and I love talking about philosophy and human relationship. Contact me if you want to connect.
